# Amazon Web Scraper  
Currently trying to create a program which is able to gather data regarding a specific item category on Amazon.

# Problems
* The data is currently gathered by finding exact html headers, so if other product page layouts are different, my script will no longer be able to access the data, as the html headers I am using is hard coded.
* It takes too long in order to retrieve the data, several minutes for a single category. If this was an application, users will not want to wait too long to get results.  

# Future Plans  
Create a functioning application (mobile or website) that allows users to gather insight on products on amazon.
